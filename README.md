# 🐧 Pylinux

**Pylinux** is a simulated Linux-like terminal environment written entirely in Python.  
It mimics basic Linux behavior, commands, and structure in a lightweight and educational way.

This project is not a real operating system — it is a fun and experimental terminal emulator designed to feel like Linux.
